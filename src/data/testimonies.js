            TESTIMONY ON MY CYBERSECURITY JOURNEY.
            <br />
            I will start by saying: May God Almighty bless the sponsors and promoters of the Oriental  Cybersecurity Training programme for transforming my life into what it is today.

            I have had huge interest in tech but didn't know which area to focus on, perhaps because of financial constraints.

            Last year, a guy posted about the Oriental Cybersecurity training in one of the whatsapp groups I belong when I was in Enugu.
            I quickly replied to him that I'm very much interested, he said I should follow the instructions and apply which I kindly did.
            I sent the advert to my elder brother residing in Lagos, he said I should ensure I do the training and complete it.
            I have had so much interest in Cybersecurity following the researches I had done on triving technologies.

            I enrolled, along the line it wasn't easy combining the training with my teaching job.

            I nearly missed the completion because of bad health but I didn't hesitate to mail one of the promoters who contacted other facilitators who approved that I should be given less than 24hrs (which was what I requested) to complete the training and receive my certificate.

            Thank God, I did. I got the certificate and professional badges from Cisco Networking Academy. That was August, 2021.

            In October, I moved to Lagos following an interview invitation from XYZ Bank, one of the most reputable banks in Nigeria, on the role of operations (Cash & Teller).
            During the interview, the Head of HR asked me that according to my CV that I have experience in IT that where do I want to specialize, I answered Cybersecurity.
            I stated my learning journey in Cybersecurity and certifications.
            She asked what if we don't have space in IT?
            I said I can work in operations which I stated reasons I can work there.

            She said okay.
            I went for medicals after a week. That was last week of November.

            I waited tirelessly for their offer letter, some guys I did interview with which I had their contacts have been placed, yet I have not heard anything from XYZ bank.

            On the second week of February this year, I got an interview invitation on the role of Cybersecurity from them.

            I was interviewed four times, the last interview was with the CEO of XYZ Bank.

            Today, by the Grace of God, I'm working with XYZ Bank as a Cybersecurity Graduate Engineer in their Head Office in Victoria Island Lagos.
            A duty I resumed on Wednesday last week.

            May God bless the facilitators that shaped my career, may God bless all of us.
            May God bless those that will engage in this training this year.

            May He repay you all 100X.
